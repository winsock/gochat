# Demo Live Client
This directory contains an example live chat client that communicates with the backend server. Currently, it only supports displaying the chat messages that are sent via the RESTful API while the client is connected.

## Future Improvements
- A strictly defined gRPC/JSON API allowing the same functionality as the RESTful interface
- The ability to send messages directly, ran out of time to implement the sending on the client side
